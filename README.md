# extendable-immutable-typings
Typescript definitions for the [extendable-immutable](https://github.com/kitten/extendable-immutable) v1.3.3 package.

The typings declare the extensible types as classes and pull in the definitions of all of the methods needed.  These were taken from the original typings defined by the [immutable.js](https://github.com/facebook/immutable-js/) v3.8.2 package.

## Installation

```
npm install -D nigel-daniels/extendable-immutable-typings
